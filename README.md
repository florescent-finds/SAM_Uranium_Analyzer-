# SAM_Uranium_Analyzer-
A desktop application using Grounding DINO and SAM (ViT-B) for zero-shot detection and color analysis of uranium glass objects.
# CREDITS AND ATTRIBUTION

This project, "SAM Uranium Glass Analyzer," is proprietary software authored by Fluorescent_Finds Â©2025.

Its core functionality for open-world object segmentation and detection relies on the foundational work of several excellent open-source projects. We adhere to the terms of their respective licenses.

## 1. Foundational Models

### A. Segment Anything Model (SAM)
* **Purpose:** Core segmentation engine for converting bounding boxes/points into pixel masks.
* **Organization:** Meta AI
* **License:** **Apache License 2.0**. We distribute the Segment Anything Model and associated code under this permissive license.
* **Citation:** This component is based on the following research paper:
